/**
 * Budget math — pure, server-safe, no I/O.
 *
 * Every expense is normalized to a *monthly equivalent*:
 *   - "regular" bills (weekly / biweekly / monthly) hit roughly every month, so
 *     their monthly equivalent is what you actually pay.
 *   - "reserve" bills (anything less frequent than monthly) are spread out: a
 *     yearly €1.200 bill becomes a €100/month set-aside so the money is there
 *     when it lands.
 *
 * One-time costs are not normalized at all — they hit the single month they're
 * filed under, and only that month's figures.
 *
 * remaining = income − regularTotal − reserveTotal − oneTimeTotal
